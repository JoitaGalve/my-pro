       "story": "INGREDIENTS\n\n For the Smashed Potatoes:\n\n10–12 small red gold potatoes olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper fresh parsley or chives\n\n For the Chicken:\n\n1 lb. chicken breasts (I like to cut 2 breasts lengthwise into thinner pieces to make a total of 4 pieces) olive oil, salt, and pepper6-ish roasted or sun dried tomatoes 2 ounces havarti cheese, in small slices (any cheese works – be flexible)fresh basil balsamic reduction (see notes)\n\n INSTRUCTIONS On Off Cooking the Potatoes:\n\n Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Cover potatoes with water in a pot. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, set timer for 10 minutes. Remove, drain, and allow to cool slightly.\n\n Smashing the Potatoes:\n\n One at a time, cover the potatoes with a clean dish towel. Mash gently it with your hand, holding it together so it doesn’t fall apart completely. Transfer to a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Bake for 10-15 minutes.\n\n Cooking the Chicken:\n\n In an oven-safe skillet, heat a little oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Brown on both sides (but it doesn’t have to be cooked through). Top with the sun dried tomatoes and cheese slices. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and cheese is nice and melty.\n\n Serve:\n\n Top the chicken with basil and balsamic reduction. Serve with potatoes. Don’t forget your fancy drink BECAUSE YOU JUST MADE A MOMENT. Yum!"
